the library that powers Node.js

Before You Start

Read the learnuv gitbook (http://thlorenz.github.io/learnuv/book)
which explains some libuv and related C language concepts that will help you complete the exercises.



git clone https://github.com/thlorenz/learnuv && cd learnuv

npm install


Running

./learnuv





Ninja

Highly recommended since it builds faster than any of the other options, so get ninja and do:

./gyp_learnuv.py -f ninja
ninja -C out/Debug
./out/Debug/01_system_info

Make

Works on Linux and OSX.

./gyp_learnuv.py -f make
make -C out
